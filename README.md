Materials:
Eink screen - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004642236520.html (being under-utilized currently by only using black but could be easily set to use colours)
Raspberry Pi or computer in general - for pi - whatever flavour, I have this running on a pi zero 2w so it should run on everything above that - probably won't run on a Pico due to space and ram
